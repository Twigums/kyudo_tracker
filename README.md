# kyudo_tracker

A plain website to track where your arrows went. The data is automatically saved every time you click end set, and at the end of the session, the data can be parsed using the functions in the python_functions directory.

On the website:

- clear markers: clears the markers from the set
- end set: saves the current markers into a text file and hides the shown markers
- show all: shows all markers (hits) from all sets
- hide all: hides all markers (hits) from all sets
